<h1></color>This is an example of Heading 1</h1>
  <h2>This is an example of Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is an example of Heading 3</h3>

<p><font color="blue">Headings go from <h1>Heading 1</h1> to <h6>
  Heading 6</h6>what I've just noticed is that Heading Tags are block tags, 
  rather than inline.  Block tags have the effect of rendering the content 
  as if it was a new paragraph.</font>
</p>

<p>So, I can change the font color for a particular piece of text. 
  By the way, here's a picture of a cat!...

<p><b><font face="arial" font size="3" color="red">Would be interested to 
  know how I can resize that picture - maybe in a future lesson?</font></b>
</p>

<p>Oh, and here's a <b><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tntOCGkgt98">

Onto...<b>How the Web Works</b>...freshly plagiarized from teacher...
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
  with each other. When a person goes to a web
  page like www.google.com, their computer sends
  a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The
  server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
  it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

  does a good job of explaining.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
  and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This
  video</a> gives a good overview.
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains the distinction well.
</p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.
